            </h4>
            <p1> My grandparents live in Ocean Pines and when we visit we always go to Ocean City. The last time i went there was for new years. Me, my sister and our dad went inside our Pop pop's house but we had to wear masks inside. Then we all went out to eat sea food, I think it was called The Fishermans Inn.  </p1>
